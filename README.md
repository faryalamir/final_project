# 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations Analysis
## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of flight delays and cancellations in the year 2015. The dataset contains information about flight cancellations, reasons for delays, cancellations by state, and various aspects related to flight operations. Our analysis aims to uncover insights and trends in flight data to improve flight management and passenger experience.

## Data Analysis
### Reasons for Flight Delays
We investigated the reasons for flight delays and identified which reasons had the most cancellations. This analysis provides valuable information for airlines to address the primary causes of delays.

### Cancellations by State
We examined cancellations by state, helping airlines identify regions with higher cancellation rates and improving service quality in those areas.

### Unique Airlines
We determined how many unique airlines are present in the dataset and listed their names.

### Average Departure Delay
We calculated the average departure delay for each airline in the dataset, allowing airlines to assess their performance and make necessary improvements.

### Origin Airport with Highest Departures
We found the origin airport with the highest number of departures, which is crucial information for airlines and airport authorities.

### Monthly Cancellation Analysis
We conducted a monthly cancellation analysis, highlighting patterns and trends in flight cancellations. We also predicted cancellations based on the month with the minimum cancellations, aiding in proactive scheduling.

## Machine Learning Models
In our analysis of flight data, we applied three machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The high accuracy values obtained from these models indicate their effectiveness in predicting flight cancellations.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Achieved an accuracy of approximately 99.95%, highlighting its ability to make precise predictions based on the proximity of data points.

- **Random Forest:** Demonstrated remarkable accuracy, with a score of approximately 99.95%, showcasing the strength of ensemble methods in handling complex datasets.

- **Decision Tree:** While slightly lower in accuracy at approximately 99.94%, offers an interpretable and transparent approach for making predictions.

In summary, all three models delivered exceptional accuracy, making them valuable tools for predicting flight cancellations and enhancing the efficiency of flight management systems. The choice of model can be tailored to specific requirements, considering factors such as interpretability, computational resources, and dataset characteristics. These results underscore the potential for machine learning to significantly improve flight scheduling and passenger experience.

## Conclusion
The analysis of 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations provides valuable insights for airlines, airports, and aviation authorities. It addresses the root causes of delays, highlights cancellation patterns, and offers machine learning models for precise predictions. This information is essential for enhancing flight management and ensuring a better experience for passengers.
